          <h1>My Essay</h1>
          <p>The crisp autumn air of 2010s Morningside Heights always illustrated an afternoon of fun after school. This first Friday of the school year was nothing different. After our moms picked us up, we all sprinted down the hill, ran through the street light, and quickly found ourselves upon the most popular playground in Morningside Heights. Usually, we would take turns riding and pushing each other off the swings, but today we had our own time-honored plans. The first Friday was always fitting for an adventurous excursion. “Big Rock!” we all shouted as we threw our backpacks to our moms and sprinted away. While staying in eyesight, of course, we raced down the walkway, accompanied by gray bushy-tailed oak mountaineers and fallen fall foliage, to meet our favorite neighborhood landmark. As I ran down the pathway of Riverside Park, I could feel the wind brush over my first day of school haircut, and all I could think of was beating Charles and Emilio to the checker-flagged fountain. Here was our stopping point. To escape the scare of being yelled at, we agitatedly waited for our parents at the fountain, but right when they arrived, we scampered down the secluded, teetering, century-old stairs. And there was our destination. It had only been a summer since we espied it, but the feeling never changed. This was Big Rock.</p>
          <p>Your first feeling when you step into Big Rock is always weird. Has anything changed? Where is everyone? There are eight million people in this city; why are we the only ones here? Yet soon after, all you can think of is the beauty that lies ahead. First, I see the two barricading oak trees we would use as endzones for competitive two-hand touch football. And then the lurid, amber, and crimson leaves, framing our prize, adjacent to unknown mysterious berry bushes I’m sure Theo devoured. Then, when you look west, you see the historic Hudson River. Partitioned by the West Side Highway, waves crash on the Riverside rocks, and white caps flow behind as the barges leave the 72nd Street Boat Basin. My peers and I still cherish all these little details, yet Big Rock remains the largest in our minds. Seemingly grand, four-foot Blake never stood a chance of climbing this mountain, yet tried every single time. The shiny reflective granite might as well have been a racetrack, as each member of our friend group jumped onto our rock, then slipped and fell till we reached the next tier. Our heads stood angled towards daybreak for a decade, growing up fearing this unique part of our childhood. </p>
          <p>New Yorkers love to brag about the diversity and this melting pot we call our home. However, what makes the city special are those small personal spots, that you won’t find movies describing, and makes memories we will only share stories with our future children. Parallel to New York, our early impressions of this dense city are vast and intimidating, with only a touch of adventurousness. Yet those secretive family-exclusive landmarks make your New York unique; for me, that was Big Rock.</p>
          <p>We act like this is our home, our safe place, and none of New York knows it. Here is my section of New York City for me to love, desire, and cherish. Still, everyone has their place in the city that holds an emotional value, that no one else could ever understand. Times Square and the convoluted subway lines first catch your eye, but as you grow, your city becomes smaller and more personal. The Capital of the World is perceived as if it is yours.</p>
          <p>You can find large rocks anywhere. Go to Central Park, and you’ll find the same looking metamorphic rock I grew up loving. If a random person sees my New York, they can’t be as blown away as my classmates and me; because here, in our unique New York, we hold a different appreciation. We love our small section of this massive park because it’s not like the popular ones in Central Park or Prospect Park. In those places, they symbolize just a fun rock, with some picnics and new people every day. But here, there are just a couple of days of traffic each year. On the first Friday and the last day of school, it was our ritual to trek ten extra minutes to play at Big Rock. We gave this place an emotional connection, a place we thought of as hidden and off the beaten path. There’s still a possibility one person walked into Riverside Park, stepped down our stairs at the fountain, and chose to explore this massive rock. But I like it better in my head. Knowing this is our place, our beloved nook in this dense city, makes Big Rock home.</p>
